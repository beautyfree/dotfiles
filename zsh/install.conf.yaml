# Ideally we would set this up so that this clean, and all the links happened in the same place.
# That would probably mean having all modules expose a `fish_functions`, but do the linking in the Rakefile
#
# In the mean time, we can just make any task that links functions depend on `:fish`

#     ~/.config/fish/functions:
